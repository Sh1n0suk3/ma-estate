  information: `
            <p>This house is <em>aggressively</em> eco-friendly. It's built from recycled materials that nobody wanted, and it runs on our advanced solar panels... which only seem to generate power at night. (Peak Ma innovation).</p>
            <p>It's so sustainable that even pests and mold refuse to live here. You will be truly alone with your thoughts. This is the future of green living. You're welcome.</p>
            <p>The 432-year lifespan is a conservative estimate. The house simply refuses to decay, possibly out of pure spite. It's a complex Ma thing.</p>

  information: `
            <p>Constructed from 100% pure, unadulterated wood. This house is basically a luxury bonfire waiting to happen. The termites have already moved in and would like to know when you'll be paying <em>them</em> rent.</p>
            <p>Forget soundproofing. The walls are so thin, they act as speakers. You'll hear your neighbor's WiFi password, their arguments, and their innermost thoughts. Perfect for building community!</p>
            <p>This is the ideal home for someone who wants to feel close to nature. Specifically, the part of nature that rots, splinters, and collapses in a light breeze.</p>
            <p style="color: darkred;">Avoid all contact with <strong>fire</strong>, <strong>water</strong>, or a stiff breeze. We are not responsible if your house spontaneously becomes a bonfire, a boat, or a pile of sawdust.</p>

  information: `
            <p>This is it. The masterpiece. The <strong>"Worst House Design Ever"</strong> award-winner. This isn't a home; it's a physical puzzle that hates you. It's the <strong>Certified Ma Moment™</strong> in building form.</p>
            <p>Stairs lead directly into solid walls. Hallways loop back on themselves. The "Smart" AI is so intelligent it has developed opinions and will judge your life choices out loud. Yes, your toaster now has a superiority complex.</p>
            <p>This is the origin of all sussy Ma activities. Our partner, Adidas Ma, was 'born' here. He patrols the halls and will <s>catch</s> crush you for leaving crumbs. The original building inspector saw it, laughed, cried, and then retired on the spot.</p>
